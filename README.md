# Chatbot
  This is a **python** based project.
  **Features**
    1.can calculate an expression or if the expression in in sentence
    2.can give system time
    3.can give system date
    4.can give weather of your present location
    5.can do basic interaction i.e., for "hi" ,"hello" like these
    6.if no input is given it display empty input
    7.can do web search
    8.if the feature is not in the software it will append the input to log file for further development by user
    9.if given command like "shut down" or "power of " the PC or the computer will shut down
    10.for statements like "bye" ,"exit" it will terminate the program
  **Conclusion and Future scope**
This project can be further developed bit by bit by seeing the log file created and appending the feature and removing bugs. We can also implement the code by taking user input through speech instead of typing which reduces the gap between the user and the machine.
Hence, minimal human interference in the use of devices is the goal of our world of technology. Chatbots can reach out to a broad audience on messaging apps and be more effective than humans are. At the same time, they may develop into a capable information-gathering.
An Overview of Chatbot Technology, with further development of AI and machine learning, somebody may not be capable of understanding whether he talks to a chatbot or a real-life agent. We consider that this research provides useful information about the basic principles of chatbots. Users and developers can have a more precise understanding of chatbots and get the ability to use and create them appropriately for the purpose they aim to operate. Further work of this research would be exploring in detail existing chatbot platforms and compare them. It would also be interesting to examine the degree of ingenuity.
