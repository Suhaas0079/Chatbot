# Chatbot
  This is a **python** based project.
  **Features**
    1. Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year, next Monday, last week of month, etc).
    2. Computing of relative deltas between two given date and/or datetime objects.
    3. Computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules, using a superset of the iCalendar specification. Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.
    4. Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format.
    5. Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar format            files, given ranges (with help fromdeltas), local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone, and Windows registry-based time zones.
    6. Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on Olsonâ€™s database.
    7. Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year, using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms.
    8. A comprehensive test suite. 
  **Conclusion and Future scope**
This project can be further developed bit by bit by seeing the log file created and appending the feature and removing bugs. We can also implement the code by taking user input through speech instead of typing which reduces the gap between the user and the machine.
Hence, minimal human interference in the use of devices is the goal of our world of technology. Chatbots can reach out to a broad audience on messaging apps and be more effective than humans are. At the same time, they may develop into a capable information-gathering.
An Overview of Chatbot Technology, with further development of AI and machine learning, somebody may not be capable of understanding whether he talks to a chatbot or a real-life agent. We consider that this research provides useful information about the basic principles of chatbots. Users and developers can have a more precise understanding of chatbots and get the ability to use and create them appropriately for the purpose they aim to operate. Further work of this research would be exploring in detail existing chatbot platforms and compare them. It would also be interesting to examine the degree of ingenuity.
